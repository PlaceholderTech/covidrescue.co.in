## üî© Installation

Installation is simple. To run the project locally, follow the below steps:

**Clone the repository**

- `git clone https://github.com/PlaceholderTech/covidrescue.co.in.git`

**Install the packages**

- `npm install` or `yarn`

Create a `.env.local` file to setup your environment variables. Example of .env file is provided in the repository as `.env.example`

```bash
TWITTER_API_KEY = ''
TWITTER_API_SECRET = ''
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN = ''
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN = ''
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = ''
GOVT_DATA_API = ''
EMAIL=''
APPLICATION_PASSWORD=''

MYSQL_HOST=''
MYSQL_DATABASE=''
MYSQL_USERNAME=''
MYSQL_PASSWORD=''
MYSQL_PORT=''
```

#### üïä Setting up Twitter API for fetching tweets

For the Twitter posts to work, you need to create a Twitter Standard V2 Account. You can do it [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/getting-started).

Approving of the Developer portal may take 1 day or more.
Once you have the Twitter API credentials, populate the `.env.example` file and you're good to go.

#### üíª Setting up MySQL for storing users

Note: Users are deleted when the notification is sent to the user.

Setup a MySQL server on your system. Create a user and get the following credentials:

```bash
MYSQL_HOST
MYSQL_DATABASE
MYSQL_USERNAME
MYSQL_PASSWORD
MYSQL_PORT
```

#### ‚úâÔ∏è Sending Emails

- Make your Gmail application `less secure`. Visit [This Link](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) for more information.
- Once you're done, Feed your Email and Password in `.env.local` file.

```bash
EMAIL=''
APPLICATION_PASSWORD=''
```

For sending the automated emails, We've written a **Cron Job** that pings the `CoWIN API` every 1 minute. You can find the script under `/scripts` folder.

You can run that script on your local node-express server for running the corn job.

## ü¶æ Usage

To run the application locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

```bash
yarn dev
```
